# 🕵️‍♂️ Dark Pattern Detection AI Agent
## 📌 Overview
This project is a functional prototype of an AI agent that detects dark patterns (deceptive design practices) in websites. It analyzes visible website content and identifies patterns such as fake urgency, hidden costs, forced choices, and misleading language. The system uses the Gemini API for AI‑based reasoning and focuses on explainability and ethical AI usage.
